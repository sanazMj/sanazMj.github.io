# Interpretable AI, Explainable AI (XAI)

Tags: Tutorial
Text: 1. Interpretable AI: cause and effect  2. Explainable AI: nodes and their effect on models’ performance.

Interpretability in machine learning is crucial as it is essential to know why a model makes certain decisions.

1. Intrinsic **or** Post-hoc: 
    1. Intrinsic: restricting the complexity of the machine learning model. Simple structured models such as **short decision trees or sparse linear models**
    2. Post-hoc: Analyze the model after training: **Permutation feature importance**
2. Result of the interpretation method:
    1. Feature summary statistic: Provide summary statistics for each feature such as feature importance, or pairwise feature interaction strength**.**
    2. Feature summary visualization:
    3. Model internals (e.g. learned weights):
    4. Data point:
    5. Intrinsically interpretable model:
3. Model-specific or model-agnostic?
4. Local or Global?
    1. Global: Explain the entire logic and reasoning of a model
    2. Local: Explain the reasonability for a specific decision
